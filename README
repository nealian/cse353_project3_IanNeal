Successful frame buffering in bridge                                        missing
Bridge successfully transports non-local traffic across sub-networks        missing
All nodes and networks shut down after all the data has been transmitted    missing
Bridge creates log file                                                     missing
Program loads input file                                                    complete
Program parses input file                                                   complete
Program generates tokens (one for each ring)                                partial
Nodes generate proper frames                                                partial
Nodes run as autonomous threads                                             complete
Program can be executed via command line                                    complete - doesn't exit
Randomly accept a frame                                                     complete - doesn't do all
Extract all fields from a frame                                             complete - doesn't do all
Nodes switch between listen and transmit states                             complete - doesn't do all
Pass the tokens and frames to the next neighbor                             incomplete - sometimes doesn't work
Print to the output file with the correct format                            complete - doesn't do all
Documentation is complete                                                   incomplete
Well documented code                                                        incomplete
